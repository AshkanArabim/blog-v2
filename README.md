# Blog v2
All cool devs have a blog. I want to be a cool dev, therefore I made a blog: [blog.ashkan.zone](https://blog.ashkan.zone/).



Why v2? Because I had another blog project that was an eyesore. This one looks decent (and uses TypeScript).

## tech stack
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): allows writing blog entries in Markdown.
- TypeScript: Literally just JavaScript but with static typing.

## getting started
- clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run develop`
- open `localhost:8080` in your browser and see it change as you modify your code!
